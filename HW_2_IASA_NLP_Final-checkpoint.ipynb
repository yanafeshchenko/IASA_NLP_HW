    "- There were used different types of text preprocessing methods, such as lowercasing, tokenization, removing stopwords etc. I also compared how each of them influences the model performance. Conclusion of this part: light text preprocessing works better than hard(within removing stopwords).\n",
    "- There were used 2 types of ML models: SVR and Ridge Regression.\n",
    "- There were used 2 types of vectorization: BoW and TF-IDF. \n",
    "- There was implemented GridSearchCV for both models in order to find the best values for hyperparameters.\n",
    "- There was chosen the best model - SVR with hyperparameters C=1.0 and epsilon = 0.1 for the first target; C=5, epsilon = 0.5 for the second target.\n",
    "- There were several calculation of the key metric MCRMSE. The best model gave result that MCRMSE = 0.557.\n",

    "Some further possible improvements in order to discover the model performance and make it better:\n",
